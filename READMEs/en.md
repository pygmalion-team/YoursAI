## Introduction

YoursAI is not another AI chat service like Character.AI or JanitorAI; instead, it is an open-source local chat frontend inspired by projects like SillyTavern and RisuAI.

## Features

### 1. Fully customizable, yet simple

</p>

- The quality of prompt templates, lore books, and character cards currently shared online is astonishingly high.
    - However, for people who just want to enjoy high-quality character chats, this can become unnecessarily complicated.
- The goal of the YoursAI project is to make it easy for anyone, even those without development or AI knowledge, to fully understand all settings and enjoy the highest quality chats.
- This will be achieved through simple concept changes and thorough UX writing.


### 2. Modern and clean UI

</p>

- We believe that AI chat should be as clean and convenient as commercial messenger app UX/UI.
- Three default themes will be available: "That Fruit" style, "Chocolate Flavor" style, and Visual Novel style.
    - Custom themes will be easy to create.
- Supports a native app experience through PWA.
- Built using modern frontend technology for a smooth and fast experience.


### 3. For hackers: Complete ownership of your data

</p>

- We believe the potential of AI chat should not be restricted by regulations or political correctness.
- Fully open source with zero terms of service: all code is publicly available in this repository.
- Full local storage: all data, including chats and settings, are stored locally and can be exported or completely deleted at any time.
